### Author: Muhammad Shkir

#### 1.What is the problem you are trying to solve? 
  Distinguish the distinct characteristics of highly rated restaurants compared to their counterparts. In doing so, restaurateurs can position their establishments to attract a wider range of clientele.
    
#### 2. How can your insights drive business decisions?
  My insights and recommendations will guide CoffeeKing to adopt highly-rated restaurant features and attract additional customers.

#### 3.Questions
  i- What are the fundamental features a restaurant
  must have to achieve success (high rating)?
  ii- What are the specific types of food that successful
  restaurants specialize in?

#### 4.Hypotheses
  i- Pay with credit card, Wi-Fi, long open hours and
  suitable for kids are essential features in successful
  restaurant.
  ii- Most successful restaurants specialize in burgers and
  pizza.

#### A summary of the different descriptive statistics you looked at.

I  have worked with a comprehensive dataset that contains a vast array of features for various types of businesses. However, my primary focus was on restaurants, so I filtered the dataset to only include restaurant businesses. After filtering, I divided the dataset into two groups based on restaurant ratings: highly-rated and low-rated. From there, I conducted a thorough analysis of the "Attributes" column to identify which specific features are most closely associated with high ratings for restaurants. This in-depth analysis allowed me to answer the critical question of 'what features a restaurant must possess to achieve a high rating'.
