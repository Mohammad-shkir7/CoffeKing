  Geographic location and restaurant type are vital aspects to be searched to answer the big question: 'What features a restaurant must have to get a high rating'  
  - Most of high-rated restaurants are located in Pennsylvania(21%) and Florida(20%)
  - Regarding the states Tennessee, Indiana, and Louisiana host (9%) of this restaurant group
  - Most of low-rated restaurants are located also in Pennsylvania(24%) and Florida(17%)
  - Regarding the states Tennessee, Indiana, and Missouri host (8% each) of this restaurant group

###### * I have created a visual for that
  - Nightlife, Bars, American food, and Sandwiches are the top categories a low-rated restaurant might provide.
  - While on the other hand high-rated would offer Nightlife, Sandwiches, Coffee&Tea, and bars.
###### * I have generated a visual for that too.

### What jumps out at you now?
  - I noticed that there are some "things" a low-rated restaurant mostly lacks, and these include specialty food, Deserts, and Cafes.
  - Consequently, I might argue that highly rated restaurants focus on the quality and dining experience as well as the taste of the food itself. I could investigate this hypothesis by reviewing the findings I have discovered earlier.
### New considerations.
  - The main orientation now is to connect the dots, discuss several theories, and come up with strong insights.
  - I must mention that low-rated restaurants often lack specialty foods, desserts, and cafes.
  - I'm thinking of using coordinates data to generate a heatmap describing where each group of restaurants is centralized.

### New metrics to track relationships of data.
  - Prove or disprove the hypothesis: highly rated restaurants focus on the quality and dining experience besides the taste of the food.
  - Dig deeper and relate previous findings with this assignment's findings.
  - All of the above is included in the presentation.
